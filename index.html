					<h2>DDA Boss Fights</h2>
					<p>Imagine having a boss and multiple actions (especially attacks) already designed.
						Then an AI system can automatically manage the boss's behaviour.
						If we apply the system to a <b>behaviour tree</b>,
						the step of random selection will be replaced with choosing an action using the <b>Dynamic
							Difficulty Adjustment (DDA)</b> system based
						on the player’s performance.</p>
					<p>The system targets minimising the HP gap between the player and the boss.
						During the selection step, the fitness of each action is calculated first.
						Then I introduced two selection strategies from <b>Evolutionary Algorithm</b>, Roulette and
						Rank, for
						the action choice.</p>
					<p>The project is written in <b>C#</b> and developed in <b>Unity</b>.
						It was pretty challenging to create the boss’ abilities and add audio with only free assets,
						but I enjoyed it a lot during this process.</p>
					<p>Finally, I surveyed to collect players’ opinions. Among 20 participants, I found that those
						bosses applied with a DDA system are generally more popular, while players with different skill
						levels have diverse preferences for bosses.</p>

					<h2>2D Game Level Generator</h2>
					<p>This project was the prototype of DDA boss fights, and it is written in <b>C#</b> and developed
						in <b>Unity</b>.
					</p>
					<p>The generator uses <b>Perlin noise</b> to generate caves to form the fundamental level structure.
						Then in the caves, it randomly generates spikes, potions and particles (random player events,
						e.g.,
						decreasing player movement speed and increasing player attack damage). </p>
					<p>
						It can generate diverse levels by adjusting the modifier of Perlin noise, the danger degree, and
						the potion and player events proportion. There is always a path to the boss stage, thanks to
						channel control.

					<h2>Frozen Lake Level Generator</h2>
					<p>As an environment for Reinforcement Learning, Frozen Lake’s levels are not designed for human
						players. Most of its levels are not fun enough from a player’s perspective, but I believe it has
						the potential to be enjoyable.</p>
					<p>So, I used <b>Evolutionary Algorithm</b> to generate fun levels of Frozen Lake. The project was
						written
						in <b>Python</b> and developed in <b>Google Colab</b>. </p>
					<p>The most challenging part was the definition of fitness. With the knowledge of game design
						fundamentals, I integrated three features into the fitness function: the length of the shortest
						path, the number of holes and the danger degree of the shortest path.</p>
					<p>The result was quite satisfying, and the generator can produce high-quality levels of
						Frozen Lake stably.</p>
