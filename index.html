			<p>Hello, and thanks for visiting my website! My name is Cong Peng, and you can call me Connor.</p>
			<p>Currently, I am a graduate of the MSc Computer Games programme at Queen Mary, University of London.</p>
			<p>I am also a game enthusiast who wishes to become a game developer.</p>
			<p>I am interested in game design, AI and programming, and I enjoy solving problems creatively, especially
				with limited assets.</p>

					<h2>DDA Boss Fights</h2>
					<p>Imagine having a boss and multiple actions (especially attacks) already designed. Then an AI
						system can automatically manage the boss's behaviour. If we apply the system to a <b>behaviour
							tree</b>, the step of random selection will be replaced with choosing an action using the
						<b>Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA)</b> system based on the player’s performance.
					</p>
					<p>The system targets minimising the <b>HP gap</b> between the player and the boss to improve the
						<b>player experience</b>.
						During the selection step, the <b>fitness</b> of each action is calculated first.
						Then I introduced two selection strategies from <b>Evolutionary Algorithm</b>, <b>Roulette</b>
						and <b>Rank</b>, for the action choice.
					</p>
					<p>The project is written in <b>C#</b> and developed in <b>Unity</b>.
						It was pretty challenging to create the boss’ abilities and add audio with only free assets,
						but I enjoyed it a lot during this process.</p>
					<p>Finally, I <b>surveyed</b> to collect players’ opinions. Among 20 participants, I found that
						those
						bosses applied with a DDA system are generally more popular, while players with different skill
						levels have diverse preferences for bosses.</p>

					<h2>2D Game Level Generator</h2>
					<p>This project was the prototype of DDA boss fights, and it is written in <b>C#</b> and developed
						in <b>Unity</b>.
					</p>
					<p>The generator uses <b>Perlin noise</b> to generate caves to form the fundamental level structure.
						Then in the caves, it randomly generates <b>level features</b> including spikes, potions and
						particles
						(random player events, e.g., decreasing player movement speed and increasing player attack
						damage). </p>
					<p>
						It can generate <b>diverse</b> levels by adjusting the modifier of Perlin noise, the danger
						degree, and
						the potion and player events proportion. There is always a path to the boss stage, thanks to
						<b>channel control</b>.

					<h2>Frozen Lake Level Generator</h2>
					<p>As an environment for Reinforcement Learning, Frozen Lake’s levels are not designed for human
						players. Most of its levels are not fun enough from a player’s perspective, but I believe it has
						the potential to be enjoyable.</p>
					<p>So, I used <b>Evolutionary Algorithm</b> to generate fun levels of Frozen Lake. The project was
						written
						in <b>Python</b> and developed in <b>Google Colab</b>. </p>
					<p>The most challenging part was the definition of fitness. With the knowledge of game design
						fundamentals, I integrated three features into the <b>fitness function</b>: the length of the
						shortest
						path, the number of holes and the danger degree of the shortest path.</p>
					<p>The result was quite satisfying, and the generator can produce <b>high-quality</b> levels of
						Frozen Lake stably.</p>

					<h2>Mini-Game</h2>
					<p> Written in <b>C++</b>, this mini-game involves multiple <b>game design patterns</b>. Through
						this project, I have learnt how significant the design patterns are for extensibility and
						readability, and the cost of each pattern.</p>
					<p>I worked with a fellow student to complete the assignment, and we ultimately received a mark of
						<b>94%</b>. Throughout the development, we <b>collaborated</b> well and discussed a lot on how
						to make the common interfaces clean and extensible for each other’s tasks.

					<h2>Tales of Syrinx</h2>
					<p>Written in <b>C#</b>, Tales of Syrinx is a <b>platformer</b> developed in <b>Unity</b> by a
						group of three.
					</p>
					<p>One member wished to retell the Syrinx myth from Greek mythology. She was transformed into hollow
						water reeds to run away from the amorous god Pan. So, I designed the reed generation as her core
						<b>ability</b>. The player can use the reed as a temporary platform and defensive tool in the
						game.
						Then I designed several <b>puzzles</b> around the reed in the level. Creating
						<b>multipurpose</b>
						abilities has become my favourite design process.
					</p>
					<p>In terms of <b>teamwork</b>, we did well overall. However, I was eager to add more features and
						was
						overly detail-oriented. So, the project became somewhat disordered as I did too many, even some
						of which were not my responsibility. Later I realised that the development should have started
						out with a detailed plan, and the division of tasks should have been clear-cut.</p>

					<h2>Battle of the Plants</h2>
					<p>Battle of the Plants is a 2v2 <b>board game</b>. I spend much time designing the core mechanics

						others’ feedback to
						improve the <b>balance</b>. I was excited to see how much my fellow students appreciated it.</p>

					<h2>Pommerman Agents</h2>
					<p> This project is written in <b>Java</b>, which includes three AI agents I designed for the
						<b>Pommerman</b> game.
					</p>
					<p>The first one chooses the action according to the current time, and the second one involves
						rule-based and <b>One step look ahead (OSLA)</b> methods. The last one is a variant of the
						<b>Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)</b>, enhanced by <b>progressive bias</b> and <b>biasing
							rollouts.</b>
					</p>
					<p> All agents perform better than the agents in the same skill levels.</p>
